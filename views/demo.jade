  p HTML is the <em>content</em> of the web. Without it, none of your favorite sites would exist. You can write links to places like <a href='http://www.google.com/'>Google</a>, <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/'>The New York Times</a> or anywhere you like!
  p If you go to the view menu in chrome, scroll to developer, and click view source, you can see the HTML that your browser rendered. (shortcut: command + option + u.)
  p Next, let's check out <a href='/welcome/css'>CSS</a>.
